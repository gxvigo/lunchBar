Lunch Bar 
===================

This repository hosts a Node.js Express application used to implement the web site of my son's school lunch bar.
This is a modernized version of the current web site.

This project has been used as training exercise while following the course "Building a Website with Node.js and Express.js" by Ray Villalobos. 
Great course. It is the back bone of all the capabilities and look and feel of this web application
